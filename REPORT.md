# TCP Throughput Simulations with NS-
Jonathan Jones

## Result Discussions

- Describe the experiments you performed and the topology very briefly.
- You can have a general discussion about the trends that you see in the simulation data.
- Think about how each of the parameters that you vary affects the goodput. Most of the cases are not interesting but there are few cases which make for an interesting discussion.
- Does the simulation data correspond to the behavior of TCP ?
- Do the different flavours of TCP have a strong bearing on performance? Why / Why Not?
- How do the parameters / flavors vary the fairness amongst the various flows?
- Is there a way you can guarantee fairness using just the parameters you controlled during the experiment?

## Some things you can definitely exclude

â€‹- The results of each experiment. I can just run the code that you turn in.
- Verbose Explanations. Be clear and brief as far as possible. ( but hopefully not as short as Tweets either
